            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Rishika Chaudhary, a dedicated web developer and AI enthusiast from Delhi, India. Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, I have honed my skills in both software development and AI research.</p>
            
            <p>I have a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, Haskell, HTML, and CSS. My expertise also extends to data structures & algorithms, machine learning, web development, and UI/UX design. I am proficient in tools like Git, PyTorch, Google Colab, and mySQL, and I’m comfortable working in both Windows and Linux environments.</p>
    
            <p>Some of my notable projects include developing a **Connect 4 AI** using Q-learning, where the AI achieved a 70% win rate, and a **real-time image recognition system** utilizing CNNs for object classification. Both projects allowed me to deepen my understanding of reinforcement learning and computer vision.</p>
    
            <p>My achievements include being selected for the **Women Engineers Program** by TalentSprint, supported by Google, where I ranked in the top 1% and earned a prestigious scholarship. I have also been actively involved in various tech societies and have participated in hackathons, such as the **Innovortex Prototype Hackathon**, where my team was recognized for our innovative environmental solutions.</p>
    
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong leadership, teamwork, and time management abilities, which I have developed through my roles as an **Associate Event Manager** at the Center of Sustainable Development Society and as a member of the **Minerva Tech Society**.</p>
            
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, especially in AI and cloud computing, and I am always eager to take on new challenges that push the boundaries of innovation. Feel free to explore my portfolio and learn more about my journey!</p>
